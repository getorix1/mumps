Legacy Mumps Interpreter

This is a legacy single user Mumps interpreter
from 2000 (with some updates). At, present, it
only supports a pre-1995 dialect of Mumps.

The script file:

"compile.script" 

contains the command to compile the programs. 
The software, as distributed, is set to compile 
under Linux. 

Much of the original code was written in Fortran and 
converted to C.  Consequently, you will notice heavy
array usage, all beginning at index position 1!.

This is a single-user interpreter.

Documentation is in HTML format in interpreter.html

You will need to install the gcc compiler and libraries
and the 'readline' utility to compile this program.

If you have the full version of Mumps installed, you may
want to notice that running this version will probably
require the command:

./mumps

because the command

mumps

will probably invoke the system installed full version.

You can make a Mumps file executable by:

1. chmod u+x myfile.mps

2. inserting a line like:

   #!/home/yourname/Desktop/mumps/Legacy-Mumps-Interpreter/mumps

   at the beginning of 'myfile.mps'. Adjust the path description
   to the executable 'mumps' as needed.

The default is the native b-tree database (files key.dat and data.dat).
If you define SQLITE (and undefine NATIVE) in btree.c, an Sqlite 
database will be used. You must first create this database with the
CreateSqliteDB.script script file. You must also install the sqlite3 
database code. Sqlite is slower but has a number of extra features.
See the Sqlite documentation in the full version of Mumps for details
as to how the Mumps global arrays are mapped to the relational database.

Note: the SQL commands and functions for the full version of Mumps
are not presently available in the legacy interpreter.
