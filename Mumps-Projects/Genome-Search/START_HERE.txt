The idf-calc directory contains the code to calculte the table of IDF values used
by the indexing process. An IDF table is already supplied and is located in the
indexing directory (idf-weights-sorted.dat). 

You probably do not want to recalculate this table and therefore will not enter idf-calc.

The indexing directory contains the indexining and retrieval code. This is probably where
you want to go.
