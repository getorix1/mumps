The files in this directory are used to create the table of Inverse 
Document Frequency values for each genomic word (usually 11 base pairs).

The result is the file idf-weights-sorted.dat which is store in the
indexing directory above.

Calculating this table requires a large quantity of nucleotide training
sequences and take a very long time to run.

You probably don't want to be here unless you are rebuilding the IDF table
with a new sample of sequences.

If you want to run it anyway, read the comments in indexing-nt-idf.script
on detail of how to link to a training set of sequences.

Do no attempt to run indexing-controls.script. This file contains parameters
that adjust how the training sequences will be processed.
