Remove old on.* files if you want the GtkCompiler to re-create them.

If you do not, existing on.* files will not be over-written.

The Makefile as configured deletes existing on.* files. Fix this
if you do not want the on.* files deleted each time.

You need a link to ../../gtk.css in oreder for application of CSS
decorations. If it is not present, create it:

	ln -s ../../gtk.css gtk.css

The Makefile will do this.
