Spurious Error Messages

GTK often emits spurious error message which mean nothing. This application 
may cause a message looking like:

	(gtk:34004): dbind-WARNING **:  Couldn't register with accessibility bus ...

You may supress the message with the line:

	export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1

Adding A TreeView in Glade (it's confusing)

From the Display tab, add a GtkTreeView widget to your app.

Give the GtkTreeView and the attached GtkTreeSelection ID unique names.

Right click on the GtkTreeView entry on the left column and click the plus
sign in the box that pops up. (this adds a column)

Give the column an ID of the form col1, col2, col3, etc.

Under Title, give the column title that will appear in the app.

Right clock on the column in the popup box and add child text.

Give the child text GtkCellRenderer that results a name of the corm col1r, col2r, etc.
where the colX part matches the parent column ID.

Note: there may be warnings for deprecated elements. These will disapper after
a save/load cycle.
To add a CellRendererText to a column, edit the column, righ click on the column,
and add Child text.
In Glade, watch for the difference beteen CellRendererAccelerator and CellRendererText. 
They are not the same.

Please spell the functions correctly. They really won't work unless you do....

Note: if you don't create any signals, you will not get any on... files.
