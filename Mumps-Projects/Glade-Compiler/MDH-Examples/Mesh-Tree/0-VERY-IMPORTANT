The GtkCompiler, for each signal, builds a file whose name begins
with "on.". The file's name includes the signal name. For example:

	on.load.clicked.mps

where the file will handle clicked signals for the load widget.

If a file already exists with a signal name, no file is created.
The existing file remains unchanged.

If a file with the signal name does not exist, a template signal
handler with the signal and widget name is created.

If you remove old signal files, new ones will be created with minimal
content.

This directory contains files with tree code already written in them.

You probably do NOT want to remove them.

The treeStore is used both as a table and as a tree.
